==== NAME ====

X11::Muralis - Perl module to display wallpaper on your desktop.


==== VERSION ====

This describes version ``0.03'' of X11::Muralis.


==== DESCRIPTION ====

The X11::Muralis module (and accompanying script, 'muralis') displays a
given image file on the desktop background (that is, the root window) of an
X-windows display.

This tries to determine what size would best suit the image; whether to show
it fullscreen or normal size, whether to show it tiled or centred on the
screen. Setting the options overrides this behaviour.

One can also repeat the display of the last-displayed image, changing the
display options as one desires.

This uses the xloadimage program to display the image file. This will
display images from the directories given in the "path" section of the
.xloadimagerc file.

This also depends on xwininfo to get information about the root window.


==   The Name   ==

The name "muralis" comes from the Latin "muralis" which is the word from
which "mural" was derived. I just thought it was a cool name for a wallpaper
script.


==== REQUIRES ====

    Image::Info
    File::Basename
    Test::More


==== INSTALLATION ====

To install this module, run the following commands:

    perl Build.PL
    ./Build
    ./Build test
    ./Build install

Or, if you're on a platform (like DOS or Windows) that doesn't like the "./"
notation, you can do this:

   perl Build.PL
   perl Build
   perl Build test
   perl Build install

In order to install somewhere other than the default, such as in a directory
under your home directory, like "/home/fred/perl" go

   perl Build.PL --install_base /home/fred/perl

as the first step instead.

This will install the files underneath /home/fred/perl.

You will then need to make sure that you alter the PERL5LIB variable to find
the modules, and the PATH variable to find the script.

Therefore you will need to change: your path, to include
/home/fred/perl/script (where the script will be)

        PATH=/home/fred/perl/script:${PATH}

the PERL5LIB variable to add /home/fred/perl/lib

        PERL5LIB=/home/fred/perl/lib:${PERL5LIB}
